As species of the same genus have usually, though by no means invariably, some similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus, when they come into competition with each other, than between species of distinct genera.
 We see this in the recent extension over parts of the United States of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of another species.
 The recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of Scotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush. 
How frequently we hear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under the most different climates! 
In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach has everywhere driven before it its great congener. 
One species of charlock will supplant another, and so in other cases. 
We can dimly see why the competition should be most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature; but probably in no one case could we precisely say why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle of life.
